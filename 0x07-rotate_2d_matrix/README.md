# Rotate 2D Matrix

## Description
This project involves implementing a function to rotate an **n x n 2D matrix** 90 degrees clockwise **in place**. The matrix is represented as a list of lists in Python, and the function modifies the input matrix directly without using additional memory.

This project aims to demonstrate an understanding of:
- Matrix manipulation in Python.
- In-place operations to minimize space complexity.
- Basic algorithmic thinking and Python programming skills.

---

## Requirements
- **Language**: Python 3.8.10 (on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS).
- **Style**: Code follows [pycodestyle](https://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/) (version 2.8.0).
- **Modules**: No external modules are allowed.
- **Documentation**: All functions and files must be well-documented.
- **Execution**: All scripts must be executable.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd 0x07-rotate_2d_matrix
2. Ensure the script is executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x 0-rotate_2d_matrix.py main_0.py
3. Run the provided test script:
    ```bash
    ./main_0.py

## Function Prototype
    The main function to implement is 
   ``` python    
    def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):
    """
    Rotates an n x n 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise in place.

    Args:
        matrix (list of list of int): The n x n matrix to rotate.

    Returns:
        None: The matrix is modified in place.
    """ ```
